There are basically 3 levels of Kubernetes hosting:
1. Fully self-managed deployments.  Examples include a local workstation, bare metal servers in an on-prem datacenter, or hosts/VMs running in the cloud, like Google Compute Engine, AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), or Digital Ocean droplets.
2. Turnkey installs on IaaS providers
3. Fully-managed installs, or Orchestration as a Service.  Includes Amazon EKS, Google Kubernetes Engine, etc.
