Container orchestrators allow containers to be deployed and managed as clusters, and offer the following features
- Fault tolerance.  Single failed containers or network partitions do not prevent the system  as a whole from functioning, because of redundancy.
- Scalability.  Containers can be added or removed based on demand.
- Auto-discovery.  Orchestration allows services to discover and communicate with one another, even across multiple hosts/networks.
- External access.  The orchestrator manages egress to public networks.
- Upgrades/rollbacks without downtime, also due to redundancy.

Kubernetes is one of several available container orchestration solutions.
