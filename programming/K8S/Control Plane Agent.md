Control plane agents are services running on the cluster's control plane.  Different agents have different responsibilities.  Important control plane agent types are:
1. [[API Server]] (**kube-apiserver**)
2. [[Scheduler]] (**kube-scheduler**)
3. [[Controller Manager]]s
4. Key-value store (see [[etcd]])
