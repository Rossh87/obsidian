Improves on many critical aspects of [[Http 1.0]], mostly related to [[TCP]] connection use and general performance:
- Keeps TCP connections alive and reuses them.  Persistent connections are the default. Contrast with Http 1.0, which required special headers to keep connection open.  The cost of creating/closing TCP connections is a significant bottleneck in the request lifecycle, so this is a major performance gain.  The number of concurrent open TCP connections is generally limited by both the server and the client (browser, e.g.).
- Allows for HTTP pipelining if enabled on the server, permitting a client to send multiple requests on a single TCP connection without waiting for responses.  However, many servers did not implement it properly, and even when properly implemented, the server is obligated to send responses in the same order requests were received, which creates a [Head-of-line blocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-of-line_blocking) phenomenon.  This issue is addressed by [[Http 2]].
- Introduced [[Chunked transfer encoding]] to communicate to client where one response ends and another begins, which is a problem of TCP connection reuse, especially in streaming scenarios when `Content length` is unknown to server as well as client.
