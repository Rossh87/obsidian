# BFS
Often applied to searching trees, but relevant in other situations as well (e.g. matrix-walking), a breadth-first search completes every available choice branche before moving to the next level of any single branch.  In a tree structure, this means walking an entire tree level before moving to the next level.

Iterative approach is probably easiest.
