# Big O notation
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation

Mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when its argument trends toward a particular value or infinity.

The capital letter 'O' is used because the limit of a function is sometime described as its 'order'.

Constants are often omitted for simplicity's sake.  This still gives a good approximation of the function's growth behavior.  Consider two functions *f(x) = 10(x ^ 2)* and *g(x) = x ^ 3*.  *g(x)* will 
still be strictly larger than *f(x)* for all x > 10.  This usage of describing the upper bound of a function's behavior is described as "infinite asymptotics".

"Infinitesimal asymptotics" is formally the same notion, but a different application.  Big O notation can be used to describe the error term in an approximation of a mathematical function.  E.g., in an infinite series in which each term can be written as an expression based on its position in the series, Big O may be used to describe the 'tail' of the series after a few terms have been written.
