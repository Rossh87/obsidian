CSS vars are declared in a ruleset like any other property.  The ruleset's selector sets the scope within which specified custom properties are meaningful. It is a common best practice to define global vars in the `:root`  [[Pseudo-element]], but there may be cases where it is desirable to limit the scope of variable declarations.

Normal specificity/cascade rules apply.
