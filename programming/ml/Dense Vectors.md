Dense [[Vectors (embeddings)]] are vectors with mostly nonzero values. I.e. they carry information in most of their dimensions. 

A [[Feature]] vector may be a dense vector if most of the features are important to the quality of the resulting model.

In general, dense vectors are more computationally expensive to work with than [[Sparse Vectors]], but this is not true for every mathematical operation.
