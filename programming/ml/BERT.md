Bi-directional Encoder Representations from Transformers is a  [[Transformer]] based, pretrained machine learning model released by Google in 2018. It is currently the basis of most modern NLP techniques. BERT is also associated with a standard model interface that other transformer models can implement for interop with various other tools. Notably, Elastic Search supports models that implement the BERT interface and use the WordPiece tokenization algorithm.
