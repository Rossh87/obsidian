A Feature is an individual characteristic or property of a phenomenon being observed. 

Features are the training inputs to models. A single data point may consist of one or more features. E.g. residential real estate transaction data may include building price, sale date, and building square footage as individual features of a single data point.

A feature may be numeric, categorical, etc--it is not necessarily a number; however, it can be useful to [convert categorical or free-text features to embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/use-cases) before feeding them to a model as training data.

A set of features is often grouped into a single data point in the form of a 'feature vector'.
