Some problems have no efficient (polynomial time) solution, e.g. Traveling Salesman Problem, or predicting future system states.  These kinds of problems can often be modeled as branching decision trees, where decision points are represented as the attachment of new nodes in a [[Breadth-first search]] or [[Depth-first search]].  "Pruning" the search space means recognizing that certain potential decisions are a dead end, that making a certain decision would put the system in a state such that it would be impossible for a future state derived from that state to yield the solution.

Pruning does not change theoretical time  complexity, but is a heuristic that can make some algorithms practical that would otherwise grow so quickly as to be almost useless.

One useful technique for recognizing prunable subtrees is to cache results as they are derived, and estimate the theoretical best possible performance for a given decision.  If the algorithm has already identified an *actual* system state that is *better than* the theoretical best performance of the state currently being considered, there is no need to evaluate subnodes of the current state, as they can never outperform at least one state that we've already run to completion.
