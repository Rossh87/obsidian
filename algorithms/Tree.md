# Tree

In computer science, a tree is a rooted, acyclic graph.  In this context, rootedness simply means there is a beginning node.  A structure need not be directed to be considered a tree, but in CS, tree implementations are often directed, since many useful algorithms only need one-way traversal to accomplish their purpose.  

In common terminology, a 'node' is any point in the tree, and a 'leaf' is a node which has no children, i.e. from which we cannot traverse any farther, if we are treating the structure as a directed graph.
